Genshin Artifact Calculator (GAC) is a simple yet effective tool (I hope) that lets you calculate Genshin Impact artifact importance value.

GAC uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine to scan and read artifact image and then based on the selected importance preset - calculate the importance value of the said artifact.
