# GAC

Artifact importance value calculator for Genshin Impact. GAC is a simple and effective tool that lets you calculate Genshin Impact artifact importance value using Optical Character Recognition (ORC) engine to scan and read artifact image.

The project has been archived due to my discontinuation of playing Genshin Impact. Furthermore, the project failed to achieve its intended objectives and subsequently became both cumbersome and ineffective.
